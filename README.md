# Effect-of-Extraversion-on-College-Grades
In this project, we aim to study the correlation between extravertion and collage grades by replicating a previous study of Philip Oreopolous (2019). Using the same dataset as Oreopolous did, we set up a non-parametric framework for estimating the Total Effect and Natural Direct Effect of extraversion on grades. Models used include Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and XGBoost.
